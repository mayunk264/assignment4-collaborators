# Intro

Tourism is one of the fastest growing industries internationally and it is the primary contributor to the economies of most countries in the world. The tourism industry helps raise the employment rate and income levels and hence why it is one of the most important industries in almost every nation globally. Tourism is a vital earner of foreign exchange that is needed to pay for imports, maintain exchange rates. According to World Tourism Organisation, tourism generates 6% of the total worldwide exports, and about 10% of all employment. 

However, when we as tourists think about visiting places one of the criteria, we look for is how safe is it to travel to that country/place? Visitors are most likely to visit safer places. In the context of international travel, tourists may defer from their visit, if the probability of victimization in that country is high. If this is one of the top checklists that visitors look out for, then the places with high crime rates will receive fewer visitors from abroad.

In this project, we look at the influence of crime rates to the tourism industries throughout the world and in particular Australia, and other criteria which affect them.

# Crime offences throughout the world

```{r}
crime_world <- crime_clean[,-6] 
names(crime_world)[1] <- "Country_Code"
names(crime_world)[2] <- "region"
names(crime_world)[4] <- "Crimes"
names(crime_world)[6] <- "Source"
crime_world <- crime_world %>%  arrange(region, Year)
```


We are looking at the crime rate throughout the world and the mean values of each of the 8 crimes  as in  table \@ref(tab:distinct-crimes) in each of the 231 different regions, this dataset is from the UN website. 

```{r distinct-crimes}
unique(crime_world$Crimes) %>% kable(caption = "Different crimes recorded") %>%  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("Striped","hover"))
```

This section covers the overall crime rate in the world data and what kind of crimes are at large in different parts of the world. The day-to-day incidents of crime such as robbery, burglary, assault and theft — may seem to be largely an urban phenomenon driven by local factors. Urban planning, crime prevention and police action may all appear to play an important role in decreasing the risk of crime victimization is on one end of the spectrum. And at the other end of the spectrum are forms of transnational organized crime, including trafficking in goods and persons, that can involve extended cross-national networks.
Although this data is form a well known data site, the actual crime rate within each country maybe faulty due to fear in constitutional laws within the country or corruption.

```{r crimerates, fig.cap= "Mean crime rates throughout the years"}
crime_rate <- crime_world %>% group_by(Year,Crimes,region) %>% 
   count(Crimes)
ggplot(crime_rate,
       aes(x = Year,
           y = n)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  geom_col()
```

```{r highestcrime, eval=FALSE}
crime_world %>%  
  select(Year,Crimes,Value,region) %>%  
  group_by(region,Crimes) %>%  mutate(maxval = max(Value)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "Crimes", values_from = "Value") %>% arrange(desc(`maxval`))
```

The plot \@ref(fig:crimerates) depicts a column graph with year on the x-axis and counts on the y-axis, where the the years in the dataset vary from 2000 through to year 2016, looking at this plot it can be inferred that the rate of crimes in the year 2010 was the highest with a count of more than 750 mean cases throughout the world. Followed by approximate values in 2005, 2015 and 2016 with mean counts of 760, 600 and 500. It also illustrates that with the years the crime rates have been fluctuating rapidly but also with time the crime mean counts have decreased.


```{r worldmap}
require(maps)
world_map <- map_data("world")
crimemap <- merge(world_map,crime_world, by = "region") 
  #pivot_wider(names_from = "Crimes", values_from = "Value")
```

The library maps is a very useful package in the CRAN which helps us R-users visualize the world analysis better (@maps) . Using this maps package for drawing geographical maps ,we can depict the different types of crimes in different countries over the years, the legend on the side depicts the crimes which are most commonly known for. 


```{r worldmapdata, fig.height= 12 , fig.width=11, fig.cap="World map depicting the crimes within each country"}
library(viridis)
crime_world_map <- crimemap %>% filter(Year %in% c(2005,2010,2015,2016))
ggplot(crime_world_map, 
       aes(x = long, 
           y = lat, 
           group = group,
           fill = Crimes)) +
  geom_polygon(colour = "grey90") + theme_classic()+
  #scale_fill_viridis_c(guide = "legend") + 
  scale_x_continuous() +scale_y_continuous() + theme(legend.position = "bottom") 
```

Research question within this section: 

- The crime rates throughout the world, which type of crime has more mean counts and which country has this identified crime?

--> Going through the entire dataset and the throughout the years, it can be concluded that the crime rates have surely decreased with time , even though there were some years in between which had even less crime rates, but the year 2010 has the highest rates of crimes in the entire world. Looking at the world map figure : \@ref(fig:worldmapdata) we can see that the most crime is by Robbery at the national level,rate per 100,000 population followed by intentional homicide rates per 100.000 in blue and brown respectively. It also depicts the percentage of male and female intentional homicide victims, out of which it can be inferred that the females are mostly the victims of homicides at large throughout the world and the country with most number of Robbery at the national level,rate per 100,000 population  is Canada.

# Crime Offence in Australia - edited by Yawen Zhang

```{r packages in this section}
library(readxl)
library(ggthemes)
library(here)
```

```{r readdata, include = FALSE}
crime_states <- read_csv(here("Data/Book1 offenders, states and territories .csv"))
crime_sex <- read_excel(here("Data/1. offenders, australia.xlsx"))
```

## Offence in Australia Each State

In this section, we attempt to explore the crime results in each state. Regarding the Australia Bureau of Statistics (ABS), there are about 15 types of offence. From the year 2016, National Statistics suggest that the most frequently detected offence-types were drug offences, acts intended to cause injury, theft and public order offences in table \@ref(tab:crimetype). As a result, we will study the performance of each state of these four popular offences, as well as the trend for each year. 

```{r crimetype}
crime_type <- crime_states %>%
  rename(Offence = `Principal offence`) %>%
  filter(Offence %in% c("02 Acts intended to cause injury","08 Theft", "10 Illicit drug offences", "13 Public order offences"))

crime_type %>%
  head() %>%
  kable(booktabs = TRUE, caption = "Four Offence-types in Each State") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```


```{r statesoffence, fig.height=10, fig.width=12, fig.cap="Frequently Offence in Australia of Each State"}
crime_type %>%
  pivot_longer(c("NSW", "Vic.", "Qld.", "SA", "WA", "Tas.", "ACT", "NT"), names_to = "States", values_to = "Rate") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Rate, group = Offence, color = Offence)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_colour_manual(values=c(`02 Acts intended to cause injury`="#FF6600", `08 Theft`="#663399", `10 Illicit drug offences`="#339999", `13 Public order offences`="#CC0033")) +
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size=17,face="bold"), axis.text = element_text(size=10)) +
  facet_wrap(~ States, ncol = 3)
```

From figure \@ref(fig:statesoffence), VIC, ACT and WA are three safer states in Australia, all these four offence-types are below 500 offenders per 100,000 persons from 2016 to 2019. Illicit drug offences are relatively higher in SA compare with other states over four years. The offender rate of theft in SA and NSW have a significant decrease from 500 to 250 offenders per 100,000 persons over the same period. Northern Territory has the highest crime rate over the eight states, especially for public order offences. The maximum amount of public order offences was 2500 offenders per 100,000 persons and decreased to 1750 offenders per 100,000 persons in 2018. Despite this decrease, public order offences remained the most common principal offence. 

## Australian Offence by Gender
```{r crime-by-gender}
crime_gender <- crime_sex %>%
  rename(Offence = `Principal offence`, "2009" = `2008–09`, "2010" = `2009–10`, "2011" = `2010–11`, "2012" = `2011–12`, "2013" = `2012–13`, "2014" = `2013–14`, "2015" = `2014–15`, "2016" = `2015–16`, "2017" = `2016–17`, "2018" = `2017–18`, "2019" = `2018–19`) %>%
  filter(!Offence == "Total") %>%
  pivot_longer(c("2009", "2010", "2011", "2012", "2013", "2014", "2015", "2016", "2017", "2018", "2019"), names_to = "Year", values_to = "Rate")
```

```{r offender-by-gender, fig.height=10, fig.width=10, fig.cap="Offenders in Each State by Genders"}
crime_gender %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Rate, group = Gender, color = Gender)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10, angle = 60, vjust = .5)) +
  facet_wrap(~ Offence, ncol = 3)
```


To explore the crime rate of men and women in Australia, ABS provided a dataset which includes 15 types of offences from 2009 to 2019. Figure \@ref(fig:offender-by-gender) shows that the male offender rate was two to four times higher than the female offender rate, but they have similar trends over the year. Acts intended to cause injury was the most common principal offence for male offenders with 600 male offenders per 100,000 males. Illicit drug offences were the most common principal offence for female offenders with 200 female offenders per 100,000 females. It is necessary mentioning that, both male and female in theft offences shown a downward trend from 2013 until now. In contrast, illicit drug offences provide an increasing trend of male and female from the year 2015. 


As can be seen from the above two figures: figure \@ref(fig:statesoffence) and figure \@ref(fig:offender-by-gender), the crime rates of different states in Australia are different, and at the same time, the crime rate of male is extremely higher than male.

```

Having looked at Crime trends around the world and in Australia, let's change tact and now look at Tourism trends. Tourism is critical to the health of the global economy - according to @WT12, Tourism represents 10.3% of the global GDP and is responsible for creating 1 in 10 jobs around the world. The data will be using is the UN's 'Tourist/visitor arrivals and tourism expenditure' dataset avaiable on the [UN data webpage](https://data.un.org) @UN12. The data provides information on Tourism Arrivals (how many tourists arrive in each country) and Tourism Expenditure (the amount of money tourists spend in a country they are visiting). Data was collected in the years 1995, 2005, 2010, 2016, 2017 and 2018. In some instances, a full view of Tourism Arrival and Tourism Expenditure was not available for every single country in all of the years. As such, these countries were removed to preserve the integrity of analysis when comparing global tourism trends from year to year.

So, let's dive into specifics. The below analysis will look at two main variables - the number of 'tourists' in thousands of people (measured by tourist arrivals in each country) and global tourist expenditure (that is, the amount of money spent by tourists) measured in millions of U.S. dollars.

```{r global-tourism, fig.cap="Global Tourism Trends by Year"}
tourism_clean_world_b <- tourism_clean_world_a %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(Global_Yearly_Arrivals=sum(Arrivals),
            Global_Yearly_Expenditure=sum(Expenditure)) %>%
  rename("Global Tourist Arrivals in thousands of people" = Global_Yearly_Arrivals,
         "Global Tourist Expenditure in millions of U.S. dollars" = Global_Yearly_Expenditure) %>%
  kable(caption="Global Tourism Trends by Year") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position")

tourism_clean_world_b

```

Table \@ref(tab:global-tourism) shows us how Global Tourist Arrivals and their Expenditure has changed over the years. In 1995, there were ~387.30 million tourist arrivals around the globe. By 2018, this number had ballooned to just under a billion people at ~956.96 million tourist arrivals around the globe. This represents a 147% growth rate. Expenditure by these tourists has similarly grown. In 1995, tourists were spending 366,438 million U.S. dollars. By 2018, this number had grown by a whopping 230% to $1,207,846.6 million U.S. dollars. The growth in amount of tourists is outpaced by the growth in amount these tourists are spending!

```{r growth-figures}
tourist_growth <- (956957.0-387302.2)/387302.2
expenditure_growth <- (1207846.6-366438.1)/366438.1
```

```{r tourist-1995, fig.cap="Top 3 Tourist Destinations in 1995"}
tourism_clean_world_1995 <- tourism_clean_world_a %>%
  filter(Year==1995) %>%
  arrange(-Arrivals) %>%
  select(-Expenditure,-Year) %>%
  top_n(3) %>%
  kable(caption="Top 3 Tourist Destinations in 1995") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position")

tourism_clean_world_1995
```

```{r tourist-2018, fig.cap="Top 3 Tourist Destinations in 2018"}
tourism_clean_world_2018 <- tourism_clean_world_a %>%
  filter(Year==2018) %>%
  arrange(-Arrivals) %>%
  select(-Expenditure,-Year) %>%
  top_n(3)%>%
  kable(caption="Top 3 Tourist Destinations in 2018") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position")

tourism_clean_world_2018
```

So, where are these tourists actually going?  As we can see in Table \@ref(tab:tourist-1995), France was the most popular destination with ~60 million tourists visiting, followed by the United States of America and then Spain. By 2018, as evidenced in Table \@ref(tab:tourist-2018) these three destinations remained the most popular with France still leading the way. Spain had overtaken the U.S., however, as the second most popular destination.

```{r expenditure-data}

tourism_clean_world_c <- tourism_clean_world_a %>%
  filter(Year==2018) %>%
  mutate(Expenditure_in_Dollars=(Expenditure*1000000),
         Arrivals_Divided_Thousands=(Arrivals*1000),
         Expenditure_per_Person=(Expenditure_in_Dollars/Arrivals_Divided_Thousands)) %>%
  select(Country, Expenditure_per_Person) %>%
  arrange(-Expenditure_per_Person) %>%
  top_n(20)
```

```{r expenditure-per-person, fig.cap="Average Expenditure per Tourist in 2018 by Country"}
tourism_clean_world_c %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=reorder(Country,Expenditure_per_Person), y=Expenditure_per_Person)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x="Country",
       y="Average Expenditure per Person")
  
```

Figure \@ref(fig:expenditure-per-person) shows us the top 20 countries in 2018 in Average Expenditure per Tourist. Australia leads the way with the average tourist visiting Australia spending in excess of 5000 U.S. dollars. Interestingly, of the most popular tourist destinations of 2018 outlined in \@ref(tab:tourist-2018), only the U.S. makes the top 20 list for average expenditure per tourist.

Australia (also known as Australasia), is large country reaching from the tropics to mid-latitudes in the Oceania continent. The Aussie mainland is the world's largest island and the driest continent. It has a land area of 8 million $km^2$ and a population of 25.5 million as of 2020.

Australia is world famous for its natural wonders and wide spaces, beaches, deserts, bushes. It is one of the world's most highly urbanised and is known for the attractions of its large cities such as Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Perth. Some of most visited tourist attractions in Australia are: 

- The Great Barrier Reef, Queensland
- Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge, New South Wales
- Great Ocean Road, Victoria
- Uluru, Northern Territory
- Kangaroo Island, South Australia

Australia's economy benefits significantly from tourism and it contributes to 3.5% of the GDP which is 60.8 billion AUD as of the financial year 2018/19 . On a standardised scale, Figure \@ref(fig:ausbar) is a pictorial representation of the tourist arrivals in and the expenditure contributed by them on their visit to Australia. We can understand, the travel and tourism sector is a major attraction and the results shows the number keep increasing every year.

# Relationship between Crime and Tourism - edited by Yuheng Cui 

```{r packages used in this section}

In this section we try to find the relationship amongst the safety, number of visitor arrivals, and visitor spending. Figure \@ref(fig:vismiss) specifies the variables having missing values. To make our models available, we only kept the variable having least missing values. Table \@ref(tab:jointables) is the combined table of crime and tourism. There are still some missing values in the table but they are few.

```{r vismiss, fig.cap = "missing value in crime data set"}
crime_clean_wide <- crime_clean %>%
  select(Country, Year, Series, Value) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "Series", values_from = "Value")

  select(country, year, series, value) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "series", values_from = "value") %>%

tour_crime %>%

```

We created two linear models of visitor arrivals: one model used country as one of the explanatory variables while the other did not. In Table \@ref(tab:lmvisitor), we can see much higher $R^2$ of the model with country, which had $R^2$ of 97.5%. That is, 97.5% of the variation of the explanatory variables can be explained by the model. In sum, country had the absolute influence. That is, holding crime rate and year constant, some countries were more attractive to tourists. This is true, because some countries have more landmarks and viewpoints than other countries.

```{r lmvisitor}
lm_tour_crime_1 <- lm(visitor_thousands~year +intentional_homicide_rates_per_100_000, data = tour_crime)
lm_tour_crime_2 <-lm(visitor_thousands~year +intentional_homicide_rates_per_100_000 +country, data = tour_crime)

Figure \@ref(fig:lmtourcrimeresid) depicts the predicted values and residual values. The model performed well in the range from 0 to 10000; and most observations were in this range. Beyond 10000, fewer observations spread, the outliers were few. 

```{r lmtourcrimeresid, fig.cap = "Predicted value and Residual value (the model of visitor arrivals)"}
augment(lm_tour_crime_2, data = tour_crime) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = .fitted, 
             y = .resid)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  xlab("Predicted value") +
  ylab("Residual value")

Next, we built a linear model of visitor spending. Three models all used country and year as explanatory variables. However, in model 1, we used intentional homicide rates as additional explanatory variables; in model 2, we used visitor arrivals as additional explanatory variables; in model 3, we used both intentional homicide rates and visitor arrivals. Table \@ref(tab:lmspendingvisitor) shows three models were all good but model 3 was the best. There were 96.54% of variations in explanatory variables could be explained by model 2. In sum, the number of visitor arrivals had bigger influence than crime rate on the fitness of the model. That is, holding crime rate and year constant, some countries were more attractive to tourists.

```{r lmspendingvisitor}
lm_spending_visitor1 <- lm(tour_exp_millionsusd ~ intentional_homicide_rates_per_100_000 +country + year, data = tour_crime)
lm_spending_visitor2 <- lm(tour_exp_millionsusd ~ visitor_thousands +country +year, data = tour_crime)
lm_spending_visitor3 <- lm(tour_exp_millionsusd ~ intentional_homicide_rates_per_100_000 + visitor_thousands +country +year, data = tour_crime)

bind_rows(model1 = glance(lm_spending_visitor1)[c(1:2)],
          model2 = glance(lm_spending_visitor2)[c(1:2)],
          model3 = glance(lm_spending_visitor3)[c(1:2)]) %>%
  rowid_to_column()%>%
  rename(model = rowid)%>%
  kable(booktabs = TRUE, caption = "The fitness of visitor spending model") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```

```{r lmspendingplot, fig.cap = "Predicted value and Residual value (the model of visitor spending)"}
augment(lm_spending_visitor2, tour_crime) %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x = .fitted, 
             y = .resid)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  xlab("Predicted value") +
  ylab("Residual value")
```

Figure \@ref(fig:lmspendingplot) specifies that the model did well in the range below 75000. There were few outliers above 75000.

In sum, the linear models above are good models and may be used to respectively predict visitor arrivals and visitor spending. The relationships among crime rate, number of tourists and tourist spending do exist.

# Conclusion


(Yuheng) The relationship between crime and tourism does exist. However, crime rate is not dominant explanatory variable in both linear models. Instead, country is the dominant variable in the model of visitor arrival while the visitor arrival is the dominant explanatory variable in the model of visitor spending. Due to the high $R^2$, two linear models may be used for predicting visitor arrival and visitor spending in the future.
