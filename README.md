# assignment4-collaborators

Welcome to our group's - The Collaborators - final report for ETC5113. The topic we have chosen is 'An Investigation into Crime, Tourism and the Relationship between the two'. Our report aims to conduct analysis into crime trends, both at home and globally, as well as tourism trends, again, both at home and globally. Finally, we aim to establush a relationship between crime and tourism.

This report is fully reproducible. Our repository comes with a referencing file named 'references.bib', an 'Images' folder, a 'Data' folder, and a renv lock file. All these files will be necessary for reproducibility.

Details on the data used, the data's source and the licensing used are found in the relevant sections.

Thank you and we hope you find our project informative.
